# My Portfolio

Deployed application: https://ajhami.github.io/AJH_Portfolio/

This GitHub Page serves as a professional portfolio to Alexander Hamilton Hamilton. The portfolio contains information on personal life, educational background and project-based experience. The portfolio itself also serves as a demonstration of front-end web development skills, such as html, css and JavaScript. Currently, I am working on adjusting some tweeks on the email submission form on the contact page. Message will be sent to my email but will require you to go back after message submission.
